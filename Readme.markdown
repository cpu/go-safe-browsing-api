!! DEPRECATED !! Google Safe Browsing API !! DEPRECATED !!
========================

This is an **UNMAINTAINED AND DEPRECATED** fork of
[`rjohnsondev/go-safe-browsing-api`](https://github.com/rjohnsondev/go-safe-browsing-api)
previously maintained for use in
[Boulder](https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder) by Let's Encrypt.

Boulder has switched to using the [first party Google safebrowsing Go
client](https://github.com/google/safebrowsing) that uses the version
4 Safebrowsing API and we recommend **ALL** developers that find this
unmaintained fork do the same!
